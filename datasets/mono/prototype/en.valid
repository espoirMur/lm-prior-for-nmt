Homarus gammarus , known as the European lobster or common lobster , is a species of <unk> lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean , Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea .
It is closely related to the American lobster , H. americanus .
It may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws .
In life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming " lobster red " on cooking .
Mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into <unk> larvae .
Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the British Isles .
Homarus gammarus is a large <unk> , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) and weighing up to 5 – 6 kilograms ( 11 – 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 in ) long and weigh 0 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 2 kg ( 1 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 9 lb ) .
Like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard <unk> which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called <unk> ( <unk> ) .
This may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 – 2 years for larger animals .
The first pair of <unk> is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair of claws .
The larger one is the " <unk> " , and has rounded <unk> used for crushing prey ; the other is the " cutter " , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey .
Usually , the left claw is the <unk> , and the right is the cutter .
The <unk> is generally blue above , with spots that <unk> , and yellow below .
The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking .
This occurs because , in life , the red pigment <unk> is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment .
The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster , Homarus americanus .
The two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap .
The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics : The <unk> of H. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside , which are lacking in H. gammarus .
The spines on the claws of H. americanus are red or red @-@ tipped , while those of H. gammarus are white or white @-@ tipped .
The underside of the claw of H. americanus is orange or red , while that of H. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red .
Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of 80 – 85 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 3 in ) , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size .
Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently <unk> female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard @-@ shelled male .
The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the temperature , attached to her <unk> .
Females carrying eggs are said to be " <unk> " and can be found throughout the year .
The eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying on <unk> .
This stage involves three <unk> and lasts for 15 – 35 days .
After the third moult , the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a <unk> lifestyle .
The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows .
It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20 @,@ 000 survives to the <unk> phase .
When they reach a carapace length of 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives .
Homarus gammarus is found across the north @-@ eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco , not including the Baltic Sea .
It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea , only missing from the section east of Crete , and along only the north @-@ west coast of the Black Sea .
The <unk> populations are found in the Norwegian <unk> <unk> and <unk> , inside the Arctic Circle .
The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment .
The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway , which have been referred to as the " midnight @-@ sun lobster " .
The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean .
The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands : samples from the <unk> were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel .
Attempts have been made to introduce H. gammarus to New Zealand , alongside other European species such as the edible crab , Cancer <unk> .
Between 1904 and 1914 , one million lobster larvae were released from <unk> in <unk> , but the species did not become established there .
Adult H. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of 0 – 150 metres ( 0 – <unk> ft ) , although not normally deeper than 50 m ( 160 ft ) .
They prefer hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in holes or crevices , emerging at night to feed .
The diet of H. gammarus mostly consists of other <unk> invertebrates .
These include crabs , molluscs , sea <unk> , <unk> and polychaete worms .
The three <unk> lobster species Homarus gammarus , H. americanus and <unk> <unk> are hosts to the three known species of the animal <unk> <unk> ; the species on H. gammarus has not been described .
Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease <unk> , caused by the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Although it is frequently found in American lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out .
Homarus gammarus is traditionally " highly esteemed " as a <unk> and was mentioned in " The <unk> " a seventeenth century English folk song .
It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or powdered .
Both the claws and the abdomen of H. gammarus contain " excellent " white meat , and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible .
The exceptions are the <unk> mill and the " sand vein " ( gut ) .
The price of H. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H. americanus , and the European species is considered to have a better flavour . <unk> are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines <unk> with <unk> or <unk> sometimes succeed in tempting them out , to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand .
In 2008 , 4 @,@ 386 t of H. gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa , of which 3 @,@ 462 t ( 79 % ) was caught in the British Isles ( including the Channel Islands ) .
The minimum landing size for H. gammarus is a carapace length of 87 mm ( 3 @.@ 4 in ) . <unk> systems for H. gammarus are under development , and production rates are still very low .
Homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema <unk> , published in 1758 .
That name was Cancer gammarus , since Linnaeus ' concept of the genus Cancer at that time included all large crustaceans .
H. gammarus is the type species of the genus Homarus Weber , 1795 , as determined by Direction 51 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature .
Prior to that direction , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names , including <unk> <unk> <unk> , 1775 and Homarus vulgaris H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 , and also because Friedrich Weber 's description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary <unk> , rendering any prior assignments of type species ( for Homarus H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 ) invalid for Homarus Weber , 1795 .
The type specimen of Homarus gammarus was a <unk> selected by <unk> <unk> in 1974 .
It came from 57 ° 53 ′ N 11 ° 32 ′ E , near <unk> , Sweden ( 48 kilometres or 30 miles northwest of Gothenburg ) , but both it and the <unk> have since been lost .
The common name for H. gammarus preferred by the Food and Agriculture Organization is " European lobster " , but the species is also widely known as the " common lobster " .

M @-@ 82 is a state trunkline in the Lower Peninsula in the US state of Michigan that travels between <unk> and Howard City .
The section between <unk> and Howard City travels through <unk> and along the southern edge of <unk> National Forest .
The current version of M @-@ 82 is actually the second in the state ; the first usage appeared in the Upper Peninsula by 1919 .
The Lower Peninsula routing has been in use since the 1920s .
Various extensions and <unk> have shifted the terminus as far west as New Era or <unk> in the past .
The current route was finalized in the late 1970s
M @-@ 82 begins at a junction with M @-@ 120 and B @-@ 96 west of <unk> .
This junction is at a <unk> of county lines .
M @-@ 120 forms the north – south <unk> – <unk> and <unk> – <unk> county lines .
B @-@ 96 , which forms the east – west <unk> – <unk> county line runs due west of the intersection .
M @-@ 82 exits the intersection to the east .
The highway runs along 48th Street through rural farms into the community of <unk> .
The road , now called Main Street , passes through the downtown area and M @-@ 82 turns south along Stewart Avenue out of town .
The highway rounds a curve and transitions to 72nd Street running eastward through more farm land .
As the trunkline approaches <unk> , the terrain becomes more wooded near the <unk> River .
M @-@ 82 follows <unk> Street east to a junction with M @-@ 37 .
The two highways merge and run concurrently over the river and into downtown on State Street .
South of downtown , M @-@ 82 turns east again , independent of M @-@ 37 , and runs along 82nd Street on the southern edge of the <unk> National Forest .
The east end of M @-@ 82 is at exit 118 on US 131 / M @-@ 46 west of Howard City .
The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) , as a part of its maintenance responsibilities , tracks the volume of traffic using its roadways .
These levels are expressed in terms of a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a calculation of the traffic along a segment of road for any average day of the year .
In 2009 , the department 's measurements indicated that a segment of M @-@ 82 west of <unk> had the peak volume for the highway at 16 @,@ <unk> vehicles daily .
The traffic nadir was 4 @,@ <unk> vehicles east of <unk> .
In addition , MDOT has not had any section of the highway listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .
The first usage of M @-@ 82 was in the Upper Peninsula by July 1 , 1919 .
The trunkline started at M @-@ 25 and ran north of <unk> to the vicinity of Eight Mile Corner .
It was later replaced by M @-@ 48 in 1926 .
The current M @-@ 82 dates back to 1926 .
It ran from US 31 in Hart to the northern junction of US 131 and M @-@ 46 in Howard City .
The highway was routed through Ferry , <unk> and <unk> , replacing M @-@ 41 .
In late 1936 , M @-@ 46 was extended along the section between <unk> and Howard City , forming a M @-@ 46 / M @-@ 82 concurrency to fill a gap in the M @-@ 46 routing .
This concurrent section became just M @-@ 46 in 1938 , <unk> M @-@ 82 back to the northern M @-@ 37 junction in <unk> .
The highway was moved to a new alignment west of Ferry in late 1947 or early 1948 .
Instead of heading northwesterly to Hart , it was continued west to end in Shelby .
Two <unk> in 1963 and 1964 rerouted the western end of the highway again .
This time it was realigned to run from <unk> to New Era , bypassing Ferry .
A larger change around 1969 <unk> the highway designations in <unk> County .
M @-@ 20 replaced M @-@ 82 west of <unk> , to end at New Era instead of <unk> .
The new M @-@ 120 designation replaced M @-@ 20 south of <unk> .
M @-@ 82 now ran from <unk> to <unk> only .
The length of the highway was increased in 1973 when the eastern end was moved back to Howard City .
M @-@ 46 was rerouted to follow the US 131 freeway south of Howard City to Cedar Springs , and replaced M @-@ 57 between Cedar Springs and <unk> .
This freed up the <unk> to Howard City highway for a return to the M @-@ 82 designation .
The last change came in 1978 when the concurrency with M @-@ 120 was eliminated in favor of M @-@ 120 .
The M @-@ 82 designation was truncated at this time to the junction west of <unk> , resulting in the current highway routing .

The population within the city limits , according to 2008 census estimates , is 38 @,@ 232 , but a population of 232 @,@ 900 in a 45 @-@ mile ( 72 km ) radius and 526 @,@ 500 in a 65 @-@ mile ( 105 km ) radius , of which 104 @,@ 600 and 234 @,@ 200 people respectively are in the labor force , feed the economy of the city .
The area is served by two military facilities , Naval Air Station Meridian and Key Field , which provide over 4 @,@ 000 jobs . <unk> Meridian is home to the Regional Counter @-@ <unk> Training Academy ( <unk> ) and the first local Department of Homeland Security in the state .
Key Field is named after brothers Fred and Al Key , who set a world endurance flight record in 1935 .
The field is now home to the 186th Air <unk> Wing of the Air National Guard and a support facility for the <unk> Aviation Brigade of the Army National Guard .

Other notable natives include Miss America 1986 Susan <unk> , James <unk> – an activist who was killed in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders in 1964 , and Hartley <unk> , founder of <unk> <unk> headquartered in Meridian .
The federal <unk> was the site of the 1966 @-@ 1967 trial of suspects in the murder of <unk> and two other activists ; it was the first time a white jury convicted a white official of a civil rights killing .
Previously inhabited by the <unk> Native Americans , the area now called Meridian was obtained by the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Dancing <unk> Creek in 1830 during the period of Indian <unk> .
After the treaty was ratified , European @-@ American settlers began to move into the area .
After receiving a federal land grant of about 2 @,@ 000 acres ( <unk> ha ) , Richard <unk> , the first settler of Meridian , began offering free land to newcomers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area .
Most of <unk> 's land was bought in 1853 by Lewis A. <unk> , a lawyer from Alabama .
John T. Ball , a merchant from <unk> County , bought the remaining 80 acres ( 0 @.@ 32 km2 ) . <unk> and Ball , now known as the founders of the city , began laying out lots for new development on their respective land sections .
There was much competition over the proposed name of the settlement .
Ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name " Meridian , " believing the term to be synonymous with " junction " ; the more agrarian residents of the city preferred " <unk> " ( meaning " mad river " in a Native American language ) , from the name of a nearby creek ; and <unk> proposed " <unk> City . "
Ball erected a station house on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad – the sign on which would alternate between " Meridian " and " <unk> " each day .
Eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left " Meridian " on the station permanently .
The town was officially incorporated as Meridian on February 10 , 1860 .
Meridian was a small village at the start of the American Civil War in 1861 .
Its strategic position at the railroad junction led to the Confederate construction of several military installations to support the war .
During the Battle of Meridian in 1864 , General William <unk> Sherman led troops into the city , destroying the railroads in every direction , as well as an arsenal and immense <unk> ; his forces burned much of the buildings to the ground .
Sherman is reported to have said afterwards , " Meridian , with its depots , store @-@ houses , arsenal , hospitals , offices , hotels , and <unk> no longer exists . "
Despite the destruction , the railroad lines in the city were rapidly repaired , back in operation 26 working days after the battle .
Race relations remained tense during the Reconstruction era , with the riot of 1871 following a fire that damaged many businesses .
The town <unk> in the aftermath of the Civil War , and experienced its " Golden Age " from 1880 to 1910 .
The railroads in the area provided for a means of transportation and an influx of industries , which caused a population boom .
As the population rose , commercial activity increased in the downtown area .
Between 1890 and 1930 , Meridian was the largest city in Mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the South .
Many of the city 's historic buildings were built during and just after this era , including the Grand Opera House in 1890 , the <unk> School in 1894 , two Carnegie libraries in 1913 , and the <unk> Building , Meridian 's tallest skyscraper , in 1929 .
The city continued to grow thanks to a commission government 's efforts to bring in 90 new industrial plants in 1913 and a booming automobile industry in the 1920s .
Even through the stock market crash of 1929 and the following Great Depression , the city continued to attract new businesses .
With <unk> becoming popular in the culture during the depth of the Depression , the S. H. Kress & Co. building , built to " provide luxury to the common man , " opened in downtown Meridian , as did the Temple Theater , which was used as a movie house .
The federal <unk> was built in 1933 as a <unk> project .
After a brief <unk> of the economy at the end of the Depression , the country entered World War II , which renewed the importance of railroads .
The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles , so Meridian became the region 's rail center again .
This renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s , when the automobile and Interstate Highway System became more popular than passenger rails .
The decline of the railroad industry caused significant job losses , resulting in a population decline as workers left for other areas .
During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s , Meridian was home to a Council of <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) office and several other activist organizations .
James <unk> and other local residents , along with Michael <unk> , his wife Rita , and Andrew Goodman , volunteers from the North , worked to create a community center , holding classes to help prepare African Americans in the area to regain the power to vote .
Whites in the area resented the activism , and racial tension often resulted in violence .
In June 1964 , <unk> , <unk> , and Goodman went to <unk> County , Mississippi , to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned .
The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian .
Following a massive FBI investigation , their murdered bodies were found two months later , buried in an earthen dam .
Seven <unk> , including a deputy sheriff , were convicted in the federal <unk> in Meridian of " <unk> the victims of their civil rights " and three were acquitted in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders trial .
It was the first time that a white jury had convicted " a white official in a civil rights killing . "
In 2005 , the case was reopened by the state , which brought charges in the case for the first time .
Edgar Ray <unk> was convicted of <unk> and sentenced to 60 years in prison .
Meridian later honored <unk> by renaming a portion of 49th Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service .
Starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made <unk> easier , residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north .
After strip commercial interests began to move downtown , the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city .
The Meridian Historic <unk> and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979 , and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985 .
Meridian Main Street organized several projects to <unk> downtown , including the construction of a new Amtrak Station in 1997 based on the design of the historic train station used during Meridian 's Golden Age ; it had been demolished .
Other projects included the renovation of the <unk> Building in 2001 and <unk> 's Restaurant in 2002 , as well as support for integrated urban design .
Meridian Main Street , along with The Riley Foundation , helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera House in 2006 for use as the " Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts . "
After ownership of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007 , the two organizations , along with the Meridian Downtown Association , spearheaded the downtown <unk> effort .
The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization , allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing , and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations .
Plans were underway to renovate the <unk> Building , but newly elected Mayor <unk> Barry killed the plans in early 2010 .
Today , the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown ; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops , restaurants , and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night .
The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events , and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown .
Given Meridian 's site as a railroad junction , its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels .
Even before Meridian reached its " Golden Age , " several large hotels , including the Great Southern and the Grand Avenue hotels , were built before the start of the 20th century .
With the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original Union Station in 1906 , many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers .
The <unk> Hotel was constructed in 1905 , and the Terminal Hotel was constructed in 1910 .
Hotel Meridian was constructed in 1907 , and Union Hotel was built in 1908 .
Union Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , and both Hotel Meridian and Grand Avenue Hotel were listed as contributing properties to the Meridian Urban Center Historic District .
As the city grew , the hotels reflected ambitions of the strong economy , as evidenced by the eleven @-@ story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in 1927 .
Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , the Lamar Hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building .
In 1988 it was listed as a Mississippi Landmark .
The <unk> Young Hotel was built in 1931 .
A staple in the African @-@ American business district that developed west of the city 's core , the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American could find a room .
As the city suburbs developed in the 1960s and ' 70s , most hotels moved outside of downtown . <unk> of the Riley Center in 2006 has increased demand and a push for a new downtown hotel .
The <unk> Building has been proposed for redevelopment for this purpose , but restoration efforts stalled with a change in city administrations .
The <unk> Preservation Society was formed in 2013 to raise public awareness and support for the building 's renovation , featuring tours of the first floor and anniversary events .
Meridian has nine historic districts that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .
The Meridian Downtown Historic District is a combination of two older districts , the Meridian Urban Center Historic District and the Union Station Historic District .

The <unk> of Old Red <unk> , laid down from <unk> to 370 million years ago , were created as earlier <unk> rocks , <unk> by the formation of <unk> , eroded and then were deposited into river <unk> .
The freshwater Lake <unk> existed on the edges of the eroding mountains , stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth .
The structure of Papa <unk> is largely made up of ashes and <unk> from volcanic activity associated with this period , including bands of solidified volcanic ash and <unk> ( <unk> ) , but there is also a Devonian fish bed at <unk> Banks .
There are numerous large boulders deposited by Pleistocene <unk> . <unk> of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , <unk> , arches , <unk> , cliffs , <unk> and <unk> that are amongst the finest in Britain .
The ' Holl o <unk> ' is a cave that passes right through the north @-@ west tip of the island .
It is nearly half a mile long and wide enough to row through . <unk> ( or Christie 's ) Hole in the south west is another spectacular cave , part of the roof of which collapsed in 1981 .
Yet another is ' <unk> 's Hole ' close to <unk> <unk> in the west .
This was the favourite of John Tudor who wrote of the island in his Victorian memoirs and described the cave as : ... in <unk> , so exquisite is the colouring of the roof and sides and so <unk> is the water ... [ with ] <unk> or <unk> like <unk> in a church .
In 1953 the spectacular headland , ' Da Horn o Papa ' fell into the sea during a storm .
The nearby <unk> of <unk> <unk> also has caves that can be accessed by small boats when conditions permit .
<unk> , grey seals , killer <unk> and harbour <unk> are frequently seen on and around Papa <unk> .
Atlantic <unk> , Arctic and common <unk> , <unk> and Arctic <unk> , northern <unk> , common <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , ringed <unk> and great black @-@ backed gull all breed on the island , and numerous migratory species have been recorded .
There is a <unk> of wild flowers , including mountain <unk> , spring <unk> and <unk> as well as the ubiquitous <unk> .
The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around Papa <unk> are a Special Area of Conservation .
The traditional Shetland Pony is still bred .
Human settlement of the island dates from circa 3000 BC and there are remains of several Neolithic burial chambers known as ' heel @-@ shaped <unk> ' .
Little is known of the pre @-@ Celtic and Celtic eras , but when the Norse arrived it is likely they found a religious settlement as the name of the island derives from <unk> <unk> meaning " Big island of the <unk> " ( Celtic monks ) , in distinction to Papa Little some 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) to the west .
Papa <unk> is the subject of a <unk> manuscript written in Old Norse , which is the oldest surviving document from Shetland .
It deals with a dramatic incident in the house of Duke <unk> <unk> , who was later to become King <unk> V of Norway .
There is a circle of stones near the beach at <unk> <unk> , which are the remains of a ' <unk> ' , or local assembly .
This was the scene of a duel , fought and won by Lord <unk> <unk> , who was accused of corruption in the <unk> document and was later called ‘ <unk> de <unk> ’ .
( The story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above . )
The remains of Duke <unk> 's thirteenth @-@ century house are still visible near <unk> <unk> .
In <unk> Shetland came under nominal Scottish control , although the Norse ' <unk> of Norway ' kept their Papa <unk> estates until the 17th century .
In the 16th century merchants from <unk> and Hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet .
By the 18th century , two Scottish <unk> , Thomas <unk> of <unk> , and Arthur <unk> of <unk> , owned the island .
They maintained a prosperous <unk> ( Old Norse : ' deep sea ' ) fishing industry , undertaken in the summer months using six @-@ <unk> boats known as <unk> .
In addition to the <unk> colony on <unk> <unk> there may have been another at <unk> <unk> overlooking <unk> <unk> .
A recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed 18th century colony .
The island church , which <unk> Kirk Sand in the bay of Fore <unk> , was founded in 1806 .
300 metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of <unk> or <unk> on the headland between the west end of Kirk Sand and the bay of <unk> .
It is called the ' <unk> <unk> ' by locals and referred to by the Ordnance Survey as " the site of a <unk> chapel belonging to about the twelfth century " .
There is a tradition that the work there was <unk> with by supernatural powers and that each day 's work on the building was destroyed during the night .
Eventually the <unk> were moved overnight by these <unk> agencies to the present site of the church and work was re @-@ commenced there successfully .
Excavations in 2004 found little besides large blocks of <unk> and a piece of whalebone rib , suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it .
In the 19th century the <unk> fishing station in West <unk> was opened and the island had a population of 360 people or more .
However , fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam <unk> saw a fall in population from the 1870s on .
At this time another duel entered the history of Papa <unk> .
Edwin Lindsay , an Indian army officer and the son of the 6th Earl of <unk> , was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one .
He spent 26 years as a prisoner before the Quaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in 1835 .
Lindsay 's Well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe .
There are good examples of horizontal water mills , also known as Norse or <unk> Mills , around Dutch Loch .
Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs , built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill @-@ stone was sited .
Inside the building there was a fixed lower <unk> , and a rotating upper <unk> driven by the water falling onto the <unk> below .
Some were still in use on Papa <unk> in the early years of the 20th century , and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of <unk> , at <unk> in the south <unk> of Shetland .
In common with many small Scottish islands , Papa <unk> 's population peaked in the 19th century and has experienced a significant decline since then ( see e.g. <unk> ) .
By 1970 the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen ' fairly elderly ' residents , but an advertisement in Exchange and Mart reversed the decline .
A <unk> and five sheep were offered free of charge to <unk> which brought a flood of applicants .
By 1981 the census recorded a population of 33 .
However , by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious <unk> between <unk> led to several court cases .
A number of people left the island and the school closed .
By early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left .
The 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 - during the decade 2011 @-@ 11 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4 % to 103 @,@ 702 .
The coasts around Papa <unk> have claimed numerous wrecks .
In <unk> , <unk> <unk> alone has sunk Dutch , French , German and Norwegian ships .
The Aberdeen trawler Ben Doran <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> 3 miles northwest of Papa <unk> , on the evening of 28 March 1930 while on her way to the village of <unk> to land her catch .
When she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing trawler saw , and reported the wreck .
By the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the <unk> and local volunteers ( there being no lifeboat in Shetland at that time ) , weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the <unk> .
A request had been made for the <unk> lifeboat from Orkney , only 120 miles away , to launch , but the request was made too late to be of help .
All 9 crew perished in the wreck .
Only 3 bodies were recovered , that of James Mitchell , which was returned to Aberdeen , and the bodies of J. <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which were buried in <unk> .
The cargo ship SS <unk> ran aground in fog on <unk> <unk> in February 1940 .
On this occasion the conditions were <unk> and only the ship and cargo were lost .
In 1967 the Aberdeen trawler <unk> ran aground in <unk> Sound at the bottom of the 60 metres ( 200 feet ) cliffs .
The 12 man crew were rescued by the <unk> lifeboat , the <unk> being awarded the <unk> silver medal for this rescue .
Papa <unk> 's most recent <unk> occurred on 9 December 1977 when the Aberdeen trawler Elinor Viking <unk> , <unk> Alec <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> came to the scene but was unable to get near enough to rescue the crew because of the sea conditions .
At the request of Alec Webster , <unk> Station Officer , <unk> , a volunteer crew in a British Airways <unk> <unk> helicopter from <unk> Airport was <unk> .
They managed to <unk> all the boat 's crew to safety within hours of the <unk> , despite the storm force winds .
The helicopter crew later received a number of awards for bravery .
There was no loss of life , but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on the <unk> in 1979 , and may also have been the example required for the formation of the present Search and Rescue helicopter unit , based at <unk> Airport .
<unk> is the mainstay of island life . <unk> form the backbone of the agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept , including cattle , pigs , goats , chickens , ducks and <unk> . <unk> are grown too , often in the shelter of circular walls , such plots being known as ' <unk> <unk> ' . <unk> is still conducted but on a relatively small scale .
There is a post office at the pier , but no shop . <unk> electricity only came to the island at the close of the twentieth century .
The Papa <unk> Project is a Christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues . <unk> now sail across the Sound of Papa to West <unk> on the Shetland <unk> .
The crossing takes 45 minutes , and although the <unk> carries cars , there is only one short road on the <unk> visiting <unk> the four main <unk> provide good shelter , but the strong tides in both the Sound of Papa and to the north west require considerable care .
There is an airstrip which <unk> for regular flights from <unk> .
The Papa <unk> sword dance may be of Norse origin and bears similarities to the long sword dance of the north east of England .
A description of the dance appears in The Pirate by Sir Walter Scott .
The writer and journalist John Sands lived on Papa <unk> and <unk> for a while during the late nineteenth century .
The writer , <unk> and musician , George P. S. Peterson was brought up on Papa <unk> .
It is also the ' Papa ' of <unk> 's poem Da Sang o da Papa men , now adopted as part of the <unk> tradition , as set to music by <unk> Manson .
The <unk> chorus chant , ' <unk> <unk> <unk> ! ' , is particularly striking . " <unk> <unk> da Horn o Papa , <unk> <unk> <unk> ! <unk> a hidden piece o water , <unk> <unk> <unk> ! <unk> da boat da tide @-@ <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> da <unk> is <unk> ; We <unk> <unk> <unk> fish is <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ! " " <unk> <unk> <unk> ! " refers to the <unk> ' practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of <unk> were no longer visible .
This entailed the boat being some 96 kilometres ( 60 mi ) west of Papa <unk> .
The ' tide @-@ <unk> ' are increased swells of unusual size due to the combined action of wind against tide .
The <unk> final image of the piece is of the fishermen being led back home to Papa by the ' scent o <unk> ' across the water .
This is an example of <unk> 's ability to create a vivid sensual impression of a situation .
An extra layer of meaning is added by the knowledge that Da Horn o Papa collapsed in a storm around the time of this poem 's composition , so that it is a tribute not just to a lost way of life , but a noted geographical feature .
" Angel of Death " is the opening track on the American thrash metal band Slayer 's 1986 album Reign in Blood .
The lyrics and music were written by Slayer guitarist , Jeff Hanneman and are based on Nazi physician <unk> <unk> , who conducted human experiments at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II . "
Angel of Death " led to the band facing accusations of Nazi <unk> and racism throughout their career .
Despite the controversy surrounding the song and its contribution to the delay in the release of Reign in Blood , " Angel of Death " is featured on all of Slayer 's live albums and DVDs and has appeared in several movies .
The song was well received by critics ; Steve Huey of AllMusic described it as a " classic " .
Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman wrote " Angel of Death " after reading books about Nazi physician <unk> <unk> while on tour with the band : " I remember stopping <unk> where I bought two books on <unk> .
I thought , ' This has gotta be some sick shit . '
So when it came time to do the record , that stuff was still in my head — that 's where the lyrics to ' Angel of Death ' came from . "
The lyrics detail <unk> 's surgical experiments on patients at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II . <unk> 's <unk> were conducted on such groups as dwarfs and twins , and included both physical and psychological examinations .
Among the tests he performed that are mentioned in " Angel of Death " are experimental <unk> performed without anesthesia , transfusion of blood between twins , isolation endurance , <unk> , <unk> with lethal <unk> , sex change operations , the removal of organs and limbs , and <unk> . " <unk> together , joining heads .
Just a matter of time ' <unk> you rip <unk> apart " , a line from the penultimate verse , is a reference to the allegation <unk> <unk> together twins , one of them deformed ; " the <unk> was <unk> to the other child , back to back , their wrists back to back too . "
This claim was first made by Auschwitz survivor <unk> Alexander at the 1961 trial of SS @-@ <unk> Adolf <unk> the " architect of the Holocaust " , where it was asserted that <unk> " <unk> the veins together " and turned " them into <unk> twins . "
This allegation became more widely known when <unk> Alexander was featured in the 1985 documentary The Search for <unk> , which has been cited by several authors including Gerald <unk> , an expert on <unk> .
Towards the end of the song , there is a line " Feeding off the screams of the <unk> he 's creating " , which was taken from the film The Boys from Brazil in which Dr. <unk> was the villain .
The lyrical content of " Angel of Death " contributed to the delay of the release of Slayer 's 1986 album Reign in Blood .
The band were signed to Def Jam Records whose distributor , Columbia Records , refused to release the album due to lyrical themes and artwork concerns , deeming the artwork " too graphic " .
Reign in Blood was eventually distributed by Geffen Records on October 7 , 1986 .
However , due to the controversy , Reign in Blood did not appear on Geffen Records official release schedule . "
Angel of Death " caused outrage among survivors of the Holocaust , as well as their families and the general public .
The controversy led to accusations of Nazi <unk> which have followed Slayer throughout their career .
People took Hanneman 's interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi medals as evidence of <unk> – his most prized item being a German Knight 's Cross .
Hanneman <unk> asserting : " I know why people <unk> it – it 's because they get this knee – <unk> reaction to it .
When they read the lyrics , there 's nothing I put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man , because to me – well , isn 't that obvious ?
I shouldn 't have to tell you that . "
According to guitarist Kerry King : " Yeah , ' Slayer are Nazis , fascists , communists ' — all that fun shit .
And of course we got the most <unk> for it in Germany .
I was always like , ' Read the lyrics and tell me what 's offensive about it .
Can you see it as a documentary , or do you think Slayer 's preaching fucking World War II ? '
People get this thought in their heads — especially in Europe — and you 'll never talk them out of it . "
The song drew accusations of racism , which the band has denied .
The band members are often asked about the accusations in interviews , and have stated numerous times that they do not <unk> racism and are merely interested in the subject .
In 2006 , the song " <unk> " from Slayer 's 2006 album Christ Illusion drew comparison to " Angel of Death " . " <unk> " deals with the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , and tells the story from a terrorist 's perspective . <unk> Araya was expecting the subject matter to create a similar backlash to that of " Angel of Death " , although it did not <unk> , in part , he believes , due to peoples ' view that the song is " just Slayer being Slayer " .
" Angel of Death " is the longest track on the album Reign in Blood , spanning 4 minutes and 51 seconds , where the total duration of the album is 29 minutes .
Additionally , it has one of the most conventional song structures on the album , featuring prominent verses and choruses , where most tracks on the album <unk> them .
Hanneman and King deliver their ' intricate riffs ' , which offer the few hints of melody on the album according to PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand , and Araya bursts out his piercing scream , with Lombardo performing beats of 210 beats per minute .
When drummer Lombardo left Slayer in 1992 , the band hired a full @-@ time replacement in Forbidden drummer Paul <unk> . <unk> made one mistake out of the nine songs the band <unk> him with , on " Angel of Death " .
Before the " big double bass part " there is a lead section , which <unk> could not understand , as he had to learn from live records recorded with Lombardo . <unk> could not tell how many <unk> the guitar riff goes before the bass sequence .
The band members told him there were eight , " <unk> " the song afterwards .
Although " Angel of Death " did not enter any charts , it received strong praise from critics in reviews for Reign in Blood .
Clay <unk> of <unk> Magazine noted that the song " <unk> the <unk> of any band playing fast and / or heavy today .
Lyrically outlining the <unk> to come , while musically laying the <unk> for the rest of the record : fast , lean and filthy . "
Adrien Begrand of PopMatters remarked that " There 's no better song to kick things off than the <unk> ' Angel of Death ' , one of the most monumental songs in metal history , where guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman deliver their intricate riffs , drummer Dave Lombardo performs some of the most powerful drumming ever recorded , and bassist / vocalist Tom Araya screams and <unk> his tale of Nazi war criminal <unk> <unk> . " <unk> on the publicity generated by the controversy , the band utilized Nazi imagery by adapting a logo to one similar to the eagle atop <unk> , during the Seasons in the Abyss period .
Hanneman placed SS <unk> on his guitar , and wrote " SS @-@ 3 " a song about Reinhard <unk> , the second in command in the <unk> organization .
" Angel of Death " has appeared in several movies and TV shows including <unk> 2 : The New <unk> in a scene when the <unk> <unk> is turning into a spider , <unk> : The Movie during a car stunt , the 2005 Iraq War documentary Soundtrack to War , which details the role of music on the contemporary battlefield , and on an episode of The <unk> when <unk> asks a female escort to shoot her .
The half @-@ time riff was sampled by Public Enemy in their 1988 song " She Watch Channel Zero ? ! " , sampled by <unk> in their song " <unk> Hell " , which appeared in the Breaking Bad episode " Thirty @-@ Eight <unk> " , and sampled by <unk> on their 1990 single " <unk> " , and featured in the multi @-@ platform video game Tony Hawk 's Project 8 .
Nolan Nelson , who selected the soundtrack for the game asserts the song is " one of the greatest heavy metal songs ever recorded .
A Slayer tribute band called Dead Skin Mask released an album with eight Slayer tracks , " Angel of Death " being one of them .
The death metal bands <unk> and <unk> covered the song , and the track was featured on cello metal band <unk> 's 2006 album <unk> / / A Decade of <unk> the <unk> .

" The <unk> Blues " is a blues song by American folk and blues musician , Lead <unk> .
It was written in June 1937 in response to the discrimination and segregation that Lead <unk> faced during a visit to Washington , DC to record for Alan <unk> .
It rails against racism , the Jim Crow laws , and the conditions of contemporary African Americans in the southern United States .
The song was recorded in December 1938 for the Library of Congress and re @-@ recorded in 1939 for commercial release .
It has been remixed and covered by a number of artists including Pete Seeger , <unk> <unk> , Hans <unk> , and Billy Bragg . "
The <unk> Blues " is regarded as one of Lead <unk> 's best original works , but it also drew controversy .
There is doubt over the song 's authorship , with some scholars <unk> that Lead <unk> was unlikely to have written a work in a genre new to him without a collaborator . <unk> have been raised over his role in the American Communist Party and whether he and the song were used to further the party 's political goals .
Most music historians date the writing of " The <unk> Blues " to Lead <unk> 's June 1937 trip to Washington , DC , when he was invited by the <unk> Alan <unk> to record for the Library of Congress 's folk music collection .
On the first night Lead <unk> and his wife Martha spent in the city , they encountered racially <unk> Jim Crow laws similar to those found in their native Louisiana : most hotels refused to rent rooms to African Americans and the few that would were either full or refused to serve him because he was with a white man ( <unk> ) . <unk> , in some versions of the story described as an unnamed " white friend " , offered to let the couple stay for the night in his apartment near the Supreme Court Building .
The next morning , Lead <unk> <unk> to <unk> arguing with his <unk> about the presence of a black man , with the <unk> threatening to call the police .
While in Washington , Lead <unk> encountered several other incidents of segregation that are believed to have contributed to the <unk> of the song .
For instance , when Lead <unk> , <unk> , and their wives wanted to go out to dinner together , they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them .
Lead <unk> was told that if he returned later without <unk> , he would be served .
In response to one of these incidents , a friend of Lead <unk> 's , variously identified as either <unk> or Mary Elizabeth <unk> joked that Washington was a " <unk> town . "
Though Lead <unk> did not know what the word " <unk> " meant , he was fascinated by the sound of it , and after its meaning was explained to him he decided to incorporate it into a song about the trip .
The song came together quickly ; one account claims that it only took a few hours for Lead <unk> to write it . <unk> liked it because it was partly based on what happened in his apartment .
" The <unk> Blues " is a blues @-@ style protest song that criticizes the culture of Washington , DC .
It protests against both the city 's Jim Crow laws and the racism of its white population .
Its structure includes several verses and a refrain that declares that the speaker is going to " spread the news all around " about the racial issues <unk> the city .
The song , particularly in the refrain , <unk> race and economics by referring to <unk> as " <unk> " .
The first two verses speak of the segregation that Lead <unk> encountered in Washington DC : the first recounts the fact that during the trip , Lead <unk> was " turned down " wherever he tried to get served due to his race , while the second recounts the argument between <unk> and his <unk> over Lead <unk> staying in his apartment .
The third verse <unk> cites " the home of the brave , the land of the Free " , juxtaposed with the mistreatment he received at the hands of white people in Washington , DC .
The fourth verse speaks of the racism of the white population of the city , leading to the song 's end , which suggests that African Americans boycott buying homes in the district .
The song 's tone implies that the speaker feels powerless against the discrimination and racism that he encounters ; despite this , by " spreading the news " of his poor treatment in a song , the speaker uses what power he has to tell both southern African Americans and northern whites that the status <unk> is deeply flawed and that something needs to change . "
The <unk> Blues " follows a traditional twelve @-@ bar blues format .
It is written in 44 time but <unk> to note that the song <unk> should swing at medium <unk> .
It uses twelve measures with verses one to four repeating , followed by the final two verses and a <unk> .
Lead <unk> first recorded " The <unk> Blues " in December 1938 in New York City , for donation to the Library of Congress .
He re @-@ recorded the song in April 1939 for <unk> Records , for release the same year as a 78 rpm record .
The version that was commercially released features Lead <unk> singing and playing the twelve @-@ string guitar without any other accompaniment .
The song has been covered and <unk> by a variety of artists including Pete Seeger and Hans <unk> .
Seeger recorded and released both live and studio versions of the song on several of his albums .
In Australia , the song was reworked as " Canberra Blues " by The <unk> <unk> , an R & B band .
The lyrics speak of the problems faced by young Australians in the Australian Capital Territory in the 1960s . <unk> adapted the song to his style of European blues for the album Journey On in 1997 .
In 2006 , Billy Bragg reworked the song as " Bush War Blues " .
Bragg 's cover is a topical protest song about the Iraq War .
In one verse , Bragg claims that the Iraq War was not for democracy but instead was to " make the world safe for <unk> " .
In another , he takes on the Christian right , asking where the <unk> are .
Finally , Bragg <unk> the United States government for not dealing with poverty at home before going to war .
" The <unk> Blues " is one of Lead <unk> 's most famous songs and is remembered as his most " heartfelt protest song " .
There is disagreement among music scholars as to its importance .
Robert <unk> claims that the song is " peripheral " to the wider study of the blues , while Lawson points to it as a watershed in the way African Americans see themselves in the fabric of the United States .
There is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics .
After its release , it became popular with left @-@ wing political groups .
Lead <unk> was invited to perform at Camp Unity , the Communist Party USA 's summer retreat , and the FBI subsequently opened a file on him in the 1940s .
This led to the accusations that the Communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform .
The party claims , to the contrary , that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform .
Jeff Todd <unk> and several other writers have suggested that Lead <unk> had significant help with its authorship and claim it is not a genuine protest song .
This theory stems from the idea that Lead <unk> did not have a history of protest music before he was discovered by <unk> .
Since the music that <unk> recorded was sold to <unk> sympathetic to Civil Rights , it has been suggested that <unk> helped him write a song attractive to a white audience .
Lead <unk> admitted that the term " <unk> " was unfamiliar to him , and it seems out of place compared to the vocabulary of his past work .
" <unk> " is a song by American singer Madonna from her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance <unk> ( 2005 ) .
It was written and produced by Madonna and Stuart Price , and released as the second single from the album on February 7 , 2006 .
It later appeared on Celebration , her 2009 greatest hits album .
An uptempo dance song , " <unk> " was one of the first tracks developed for the album and had numerous remix treatments before the ultimate version of the track was finalized .
One of the remixes was done by the Pet Shop Boys , featuring added lyrics by the band .
The actual song features a dance groove tempo .
It talks about personal <unk> and self @-@ <unk> . " <unk> " received positive reviews from contemporary critics , who declared the track the strongest song on Confessions on a Dance <unk> .
Some critics also commented on the song 's disco @-@ influenced beats while comparing it to Madonna 's older dance songs .
It achieved commercial success , topping the singles charts in Italy , Spain , Romania and the United Kingdom , where it became Madonna 's twelfth number one single .
Elsewhere , the song was a top ten hit .
However , in the United States , the song did not perform well due to an <unk> on radio but was able to reach the top of Billboard 's dance charts and became one of the decade 's most successful dance hits .
The accompanying music video , directed by Madonna 's <unk> Jamie King , was a continuation from the " <unk> Up " music video .
It featured Madonna and her dancers <unk> around a city in a van , dancing on roller <unk> and Madonna fighting with a group of men in a cage .
She performed the song on her 2006 Confessions Tour in a similar fight sequence to that shown in the video .
An additional video was created as a backdrop for a remix of the song , which depicted political leaders and scenes of war and destruction .
" <unk> " was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance <unk> , along with " <unk> Up " and " Future Lovers " .
It was also the one which took the most time to finish because Madonna " thought it was too melodramatic and could never decide when it was right . "
The songs were developed with a remixed perspective in mind .
Madonna commented that , " Whenever I make records , I often like the remixes better than the original ones . [ ... ]
I 'm going to start from that perspective " .
She promoted the album at the dance party " <unk> " held at Luke & <unk> 's nightclub in Greenwich Village , invited by Junior <unk> to take over the DJ booth where she mixed " <unk> Up " with " <unk> " .
Musically , " <unk> " is an uptempo dance song containing layers of beats and strong vocal on the chorus .
It is set in common time with a moderately fast dance groove tempo of 132 beats per minute . <unk> in the key of C minor , Madonna 's vocal range spans from <unk> to <unk> .
It follows the chord progression of E ♭ – <unk> – A ♭ – B ♭ during the spoken introduction .
It then changes to <unk> – <unk> @-@ <unk> in the chorus , while continuing in A ♭ – <unk> – A ♭ – <unk> in the intermediate verses , ultimately ending in repeated lines of " I 've heard it all before " .
Lyrically the song has <unk> of different languages including French , Spanish , Italian , Dutch , Hebrew , Hindi , Polish and Japanese .
The song talks about personal <unk> and self @-@ <unk> , denoting a shift in focus of Madonna as an artist from her previous songs about supremacy like " Everybody " ( 1982 ) , " Vogue " ( 1990 ) or " Music " ( 2000 ) which was centered around the subject of music itself .
Among the various remixes , the Pet Shop Boys remix incorporated Whitney Houston 's " I Wanna Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me ) " with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction .
Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other , from the time they wrote the song " Heart " ( 1988 ) for Madonna but never delivered it .
The remix had added lyrics sung by band member Neil Tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album <unk> Four .
Madonna 's voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook .
A breakdown happens before the fifth minute ends , leading to the entry of programmed drum sounds after which the song ends .
Jennifer <unk> of MTV News wrote that " <unk> " is the " album 's strongest track " and that it is a " Pet Shop Boys @-@ esque " song . <unk> went on to say that it " ... <unk> evokes the sounds of the ' 80s @-@ era dance clubs that first <unk> her toward stardom . "
According to a review in the BBC 's <unk> , " New single ' <unk> ' states Queen <unk> 's <unk> stance , and though the song is wrapped up in relationship sentiment , one cannot help but hear the subtext , perhaps directed at her more savage critics : ' there are more important things than hearing you speak ' . "
Alan <unk> from BBC Music called the song " <unk> catchy " .
Mike <unk> of The Times and Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine noted that the bassline of the song utilizes The Jacksons ' 1980 song " Can You Feel It " .
The song was noted by Slant Magazine as one of the best songs of 2006 .
In a review of " <unk> " from Virgin Media , it wrote that the song 's <unk> features an " infectious <unk> of pumping , filtered synths and disco beats " .
Keith <unk> from Billboard commented that , " [ <unk> ] should keep fans hung up on Madonna 's ability to create instant radio and club classics . "
He also called the song " <unk> " while reviewing the album .
Ben Williams of New York magazine , wrote that the song is " propelled by a catchy bass melody " .
Joan Morgan of The Village Voice , in review of Confessions on a Dance <unk> , wrote : " The party continues <unk> with the <unk> , kick @-@ your @-@ man @-@ to @-@ the @-@ curb ' <unk> ' . "
Stephen M. <unk> of Pitchfork Media wrote , " The <unk> of sound wash directly into ' <unk> ' , setting up the song 's <unk> <unk> and shifting bass <unk> . "
Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that the first half of the album consists of love songs , happy and sad , and included " <unk> " into the mix .
